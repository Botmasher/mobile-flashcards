- [ ] Emulation and project submission: working on iOS vs Android
David Harris Sep 26th at 1:15 PM: "I've made a change to the rubric for the project, due to the difficulty of finding reasonable emulation for iOS devices on non-Apple machines. Your code needs to work on either Android _or_ iOS. Please specify which platform you've tested in your README and the notes to your reviewer."
