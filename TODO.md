## Feedback (December 23, 2017)
- 'Start a quiz' or 'Create New Question' properly routes to the correct views for those activities
	- [X] In order to achieve proper usability experience with regards to creating a new question, I would suggest popping the current route as Deck View is already on the navigation stack. `this.props.navigation.goBack()`
- Pressing 'Create Deck' routes the user to the Individual Deck view for the new deck
	- [X] Currently, the deck creation routes to the Deck List view which shouldn't be the case. In order to meet this requirement, creating the deck should route the user to the Individual deck view for the new deck.
- [X] `helpers.js`: arrow function for createNotification
	- good job handling notifications on both platforms 
- [X] `quiz/components/Results.js`: Restart Quiz to reset state instead of pushing the same route again (usability experience)
- [X] `quiz/components/Results.js`: Back to deck to pop the current route since `Deck View` is on the navigation stack
- [X] `App.js`: move the StackNavigator into a separate file to make things cleaner
- [X] `newQuestion/containers/index.js`: pop the current route as Deck View is already on the navigation stack
	- Required for resubmission!
- [X] `newDeck/containers/index.js`: navigate to the individual Deck view instead of the Deck List view
	- Required for resubmission!
- Animating the card
	- [X] `quiz/components/index.js`: consider [this flexible flipping animation](https://github.com/moschan/react-native-flip-card)
	- [ ] `quiz/components/AnimCardText.js`: add a remove listener on `componentWillUnmount()`
	- see [this detailed explanation](http://browniefed.com/react-native-animation-book/api/ANIMATED_REMOVE_LISTENERS.html) to learn about animated remove listeners	
- [ ] learn more about writing READMEs in [this course](https://www.udacity.com/course/writing-readmes--ud777)

## Feedback (December 23, 2017 after above changes)
- The Deck List view includes a form for creating a new deck which should just be an input for the title and a 'Create Deck' button.
	- [X] Pressing the button correctly creates the deck and routes the user to the Individual Deck view for the new deck.
	- [X] Coming back on the Deck List view doesn't show the created deck unless the user reloads the application. In order to meet this requirement, user should be able to immediately see the newly created deck in the Deck List View.
- Quiz card animation
	- [ ] Suggest adding a remove listener on componentWillUnmount. Refer to [this link](http://browniefed.com/react-native-animation-book/api/ANIMATED_REMOVE_LISTENERS.html) for detailed explanation

## Test

## Update and go beyond
- [ ] SortPicker not clearly interactable - toggle as larger view/modal below instead of cropped and placed in top right tools

- [ ] better methods for truncated text
	- [ ] subtitles passed to Header
	- [ ] questions on cards in Quiz

- [ ] decks can currently have the same name
- [ ] cards in a deck can currently have the same question
- [ ] when you add/delete a card, it redirects back to the deck selection screen
- [ ] it would be nice if questions could be quizzed in random order
